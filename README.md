# Detailed worflow 

Great! Here's a **step-by-step workflow** for starting **Project 1** (Multi-Region E-Commerce Platform with Disaster Recovery and Geo-Redundancy) as a **solo developer** working within an organization, with a focus on **organization, documentation, tooling, and project delivery** using **Azure DevOps and other essential tools**.

---

## 🧭 OVERVIEW:

You’ll approach this like an actual cloud engineer working in a professional setting. Key stages:

1. **Planning & Documentation**
2. **Task Management**
3. **Design & Architecture**
4. **Infrastructure as Code**
5. **CI/CD Setup**
6. **Monitoring, DR, and Optimization**
7. **Final Reporting**

---

## ✅ STEP-BY-STEP WORKFLOW

---

### **1. Set Up Your Workspace and Tooling**

**Tools to use:**

* 📁 **GitHub**: Version control and repo management.
* 📋 **Azure DevOps Boards** (or Trello): Task tracking.
* 📄 **Notion / OneNote / Obsidian**: Personal documentation/wiki.
* 📐 **Draw\.io / Lucidchart / Excalidraw**: Architecture diagrams.
* 📊 **Excel / Power BI**: Cost tracking and reporting.

**Action Items:**

* Create a **GitHub repo** named `multi-region-ecommerce-platform`.
* Create a **project wiki** in Notion or markdown files in the repo.
* Set up **Azure DevOps organization** (if not done) → Create a **Project**.
* Enable **Azure Boards** for task tracking.

---

### **2. Define Project Scope and Requirements**

Document the following:

* **Business requirements** (high availability, multi-region, compliance).
* **User personas** (admin, buyer, devops).
* **Non-functional requirements** (latency < 150ms, 99.99% uptime, <10s RTO/RPO).

💡 *Document in your Notion or project README as `project-overview.md`.*

---

### **3. Break Down Tasks Using Azure DevOps Boards**

Create Epics and User Stories:

| Epic           | User Story (Example Tasks)                                               |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Infrastructure | Create VNet in each region, Deploy AKS clusters, Set up Azure Front Door |
| CI/CD          | Configure Azure DevOps pipeline, Build container image, Deploy to AKS    |
| Database       | Deploy Cosmos DB multi-region, Secure with private endpoint              |
| DR & Backup    | Set up Azure Site Recovery, Define RTO/RPO policies                      |
| Monitoring     | Enable Azure Monitor, Set up Application Insights                        |
| Security       | Integrate Key Vault, Enable NSGs and Firewall rules                      |

Assign each task to yourself, set priority, estimated time, and a deadline.

---

### **4. Design and Document the Architecture**

**Tasks:**

* Use Draw\.io or Lucidchart to design:

  * Global architecture (multi-region AKS + Azure Front Door).
  * DevOps pipeline workflow.
  * Database and disaster recovery setup.

🗂 Save diagrams in `/docs/architecture/`.

---

### **5. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**

Use **Terraform or Bicep**:

* Create a `terraform/` folder or `bicep/` folder in repo.
* Write IaC modules for:

  * Resource groups
  * VNets and subnets
  * AKS clusters (with node pools)
  * Cosmos DB (multi-region)
  * Azure Front Door or Traffic Manager

🛠 Use `terraform plan` and `apply` workflows in Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions.

---

### **6. Set Up CI/CD Pipeline**

**Tasks:**

* Use **Azure DevOps Pipelines** for CI/CD.
* Define:

  * `build-pipeline.yml`: Builds Docker image, pushes to ACR.
  * `release-pipeline.yml`: Deploys to AKS via Helm or kubectl.
* Add environments: `dev`, `staging`, `prod`.

📌 Store these in `.azure-pipelines/` directory.

---

### **7. Configure Multi-Region Services**

**Checklist:**

* AKS in East US and West Europe.
* Cosmos DB with **multi-region writes**.
* Azure Front Door with routing rules.
* Geo-replication and failover testing.

🧪 Test failover using Azure CLI and Front Door rules.

---

### **8. Implement Security & DR**

* Use **Azure Key Vault** with MSI.
* Configure **Azure Firewall** and **NSGs**.
* Set up **Backup Vault**, and enable **Azure Site Recovery**.
* Document **RTO**, **RPO**, **failover plans**.

---

### **9. Set Up Monitoring and Alerts**

* Enable **Azure Monitor** and **Log Analytics**.
* Connect **Application Insights** to the app.
* Set up **alerts** (CPU, pod crash, DB failover).
* Integrate with **Email or Teams** for notifications.

---

### **10. Cost Optimization and Final Documentation**

* Enable **Azure Cost Management**.
* Create **cost alerts**, analyze with Power BI or Excel.
* Document:

  * Architecture
  * Cost estimates
  * Lessons learned
  * Potential improvements

📄 Final report: `final-report.md` with all findings, performance, cost, and DR results.
